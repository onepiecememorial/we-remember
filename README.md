# üïØÔ∏èüíê One Piece Community Memorials

_"When do you think people die? When they are shot through the heart by the bullet of a pistol? No. When they are 
ravaged by an incurable disease? No. When they drink a soup made from a poisonous mushroom? No. It's when they are 
forgotten." - Dr. Hiriluk (One Piece)_

## We Remember

> This is a safe space, feel free to navigate the website and the repository without worrying about being spoiled. 

One Piece, by Eiichir≈ç Oda, has been on the run for more than twenty years. During this time, it has been able to create 
a unique community all around the world that stays together to enjoy, discuss and analyse its marvelous world. Does not
matter if you started this year of have been a fan since the very first islands, if you follow the manga or the anime,
if you prefer Zoro o Sanji... Being a fan of One Piece means being part of an ever-growing family.

However, as in every household, there are those that had to depart earlier. Either friends, sons, parents, nakamas... we
have had to say goodbye more than once. We have had to accept that we will not be able to share the joy of discovering
the final treasure with all of our loved ones. Although, we refuse to accept we have to forget them.

With this reason in mind, the One Piece Community Memorials site has been created. Here, we show our respect to those we
loved and loved One Piece with us. Here, as in the Fire Festival, we lift lanterns with our wishes written on them, 
hoping our feelings can reach the departed. Feel free to join us.

## Submissions

If there is someone you want us to add to the memorial, feel free to reach out via any method. We promise to update the
memorial as frequently as required. Additionally, we want to send you our best wishes and a reminder that there is no
shame in looking for help when it is needed. Losing a close person can be hard, there is no need to make it harder.

* **GitHub:** Feel free to open a ticket [here](https://github.com/onepiecememorial/we-remember/issues/new)

In the future, and depending on the amount of requests, it is possible we add new channels. For now, we both expect and 
hope the amount of submissions is as limited as possible.

### What to submit

We just request you two things: a name and the year that person left us. For the former, anything it is fine: Either it 
is a first name, a full name, a nickname, a tag... Whatever you consider is enough is perfect. We ask for nothing more.

Additionally, if you want to add an optional short text with the submission you are also free to do so. It will be 
placed in certain views next to the name to show how you remember that person. Whatever it is, a memory, an anecdote, 
a story... it is welcome. Any language is welcome too. Just keep it short enough so we can show it.

## Contributions

A lot of people has asked us to contribute in the project. At the moment, we consider we have already covered all 
relevant positions regarding design and development, so we are not looking for new hands. Although, we deeply appreciate
your passion and interest. The fact that we have received dozens of requests already reaffirms this is the community we
are proud to be part of.

Regarding economic support, we have coded everything in a very particular way to ensure we do not have to pay for any
host. We did so to guarantee this remained a non-profit project that has no money to handle, and that it will stay alive 
even if nobody pays for the servers. 

If you still want to support in any way, we think the best approach to do is to donate to cancer research foundations. A 
lot of our nakamas have left earlier because of this disease and we think it is just fair to fight together against it.
