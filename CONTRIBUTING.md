# Contributing

A lot of people has asked us to contribute in the project. At the moment, we consider we have already covered all 
relevant positions regarding design and development, so we are not looking for new hands. Although, we deeply appreciate
your passion and interest. The fact that we have received dozens of requests already reaffirms this is the community we
are proud to be part of.

Regarding economic support, we have coded everything in a very particular way to ensure we do not have to pay for any
host. We did so to guarantee this remained a non-profit project that has no money to handle, and that it will stay alive 
even if nobody pays for the servers. 

If you still want to support in any way, we think the best approach to do is to donate to cancer research foundations. A 
lot of our nakamas have left earlier because of this disease and we think it is just fair to fight together against it.
