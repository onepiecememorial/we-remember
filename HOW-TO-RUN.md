# How to run

This project is based in `React` with `TypeScript`.

Tooling is based in `Vite` with `Rollup` as the bundler.

### Preparing the project

- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run `npm run parse-csv` so the CSV information for our Nakamas gets moved into a JSON file inside `src`. This is mandatory if working for the first time, or optional if you feel like updating the file for consistency.
- Run the project with `npm run start`.
